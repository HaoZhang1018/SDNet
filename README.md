# SDNet
Code of SDNet: A Versatile Squeeze-and-Decomposition Network for Real-Time Image Fusion. 

#### Overview :<br>
In this work, a squeeze-and-decomposition network (SDNet) is proposed to realize multi-modal and digital photography image fusion in real time. The proposed network architecture and loss functions are applicable to multiple fusion tasks. 

#### running environment :<br>
python=2.7, tensorflow-gpu=1.9.0.


#### To run :<br>
Please follow the "readme.txt" in each image fusion task to prepare data, train and test.
